# Test
## Introduction

This project was built in 4 hours and 23 minutes (with around 40 minutes spent tryingâ€”and failingâ€”to deploy it to a VPS ðŸ˜…). It was an interesting experience, especially since I had no prior knowledge of the FHIR standards or libraries, and I had to figure out how to communicate with it in a language I'm not very familiar with.
### Development

On the development side, switching to Python syntax was a bit of a brain reset, but nothing I couldnâ€™t handle with a bit of help from AI. ðŸ˜„
### A Little Spice

I added some OpenAPI schemas and summaries, since that's something Iâ€™ve been doing since last year. It also helps to test the serializers (similar to AutoMapper profiles in .NET), check if everything is wired correctly, and validate failed requests, so I can be confident that everything works without needing to run the whole project just to test for a bad request or a missing field.
## Conclusion

Overall, this was an interesting test. Thanks for reading (and for putting up with my messy little project)!
Ps. the link above works and go to the swagger!
